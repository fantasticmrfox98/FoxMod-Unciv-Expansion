Aloha to Kamehameha the Great  who the heavens allowed to unite your people! O great King  under your reign  the Big Island of Hawai'i became one in 1791 AD  and many other islands joined your vision of union in 1810. As the first King of Hawai'i  law and taxation systems were stabilized  and you promoted the Kanawai Mamalahoe  an edict to protect civilian people in times of war. Unification and sovereignty of all the islands continued thanks to your fair laws and deeds  even after you joined your ancestors in paradise in 1819. = 

Wise and benevolent King  will you unite your people once again by wearing the bright mantle of the Lion of the Pacific? Will your new empire shine through the ages of history? =
