Aloha to Kamehameha the Great, who the heavens allowed to unite your people! O great King, under your reign, the Big Island of Hawai'i became one in 1791 AD, and many other islands joined your vision of union in 1810. As the first King of Hawai'i, law and taxation systems were stabilized, and you promoted the Kanawai Mamalahoe, an edict to protect civilian people in times of war. Unification and sovereignty of all the islands continued thanks to your fair laws and deeds, even after you joined your ancestors in paradise in 1819. =
